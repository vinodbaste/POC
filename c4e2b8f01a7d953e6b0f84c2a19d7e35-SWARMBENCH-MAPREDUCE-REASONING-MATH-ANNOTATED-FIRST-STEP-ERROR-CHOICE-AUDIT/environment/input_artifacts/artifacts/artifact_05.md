You are reviewing an LLM-generated solution from the ProcessBench dataset. A curator identified the step where the reasoning first goes wrong and converted it into a multiple-choice audit. Exactly one candidate step is where the solution makes its first unrecoverable error. Choose the correct option letter. The candidate steps are presented in a randomized order.

## Problem

Frank Narf accidentally read a degree $n$ polynomial with integer coefficients backwards. That is, he read $a_{n} x^{n}+\ldots+a_{1} x+a_{0}$ as $a_{0} x^{n}+\ldots+a_{n-1} x+a_{n}$. Luckily, the reversed polynomial had the same zeros as the original polynomial. All the reversed polynomial's zeros were real, and also integers. If $1 \leq n \leq 7$, compute the number of such polynomials such that $\operatorname{GCD}\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)=1$.

## Candidate Steps

### Option A

```text
Fourth, the condition \( \gcd(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n) = 1 \) implies that the polynomial cannot have a common factor among all its coefficients. This constraint will help us filter out cases where all coefficients share a common divisor other than 1.
```

### Option B

```text
Fifth, given the constraints above, we can count the number of polynomials by considering the possible values for \( a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n \) under the conditions of symmetry and coprimality.
```

### Option C

```text
Given the bounds on \( n \) (\( 1 \leq n \leq 7 \)), let's calculate the number of such polynomials for each \( n \):
```

### Option D

```text
Sixth, for a polynomial of degree \( n \), there are \( \lfloor \frac{n+1}{2} \rfloor \) unique coefficients (because of the symmetry) we need to determine. For each of these coefficients, we can choose any integer value except 0 (to ensure \( \gcd(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n) = 1 \)), and the rest of the coefficients are determined by the symmetry.

## Full Solution

**Step 1:**
To solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of polynomials whose coefficients are reversed but still have the same roots, especially when these roots are integers. Let's denote the original polynomial as \( P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \) and its reverse as \( Q(x) = a_0 x^n + a_1 x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_{n-1} x + a_n \). We are given that \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) have the same roots, and these roots are integers.

**Step 2:**
First, let's consider the roots of \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \). Since \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) have the same roots, for any root \( r \) of \( P(x) \), \( r \) must also satisfy \( Q(r) = 0 \). This means:
\[ a_0 r^n + a_1 r^{n-1} + \cdots + a_{n-1} r + a_n = 0. \]

**Step 3:**
Second, because the roots of \( Q(x) \) (and thus \( P(x) \)) are integers, they must divide \( a_n \) (by the Rational Root Theorem). Similarly, since \( Q(x) \) is the reverse of \( P(x) \), the roots must also divide \( a_0 \).

**Step 4:**
Third, for the roots to remain the same under reversal of coefficients, it must be true that \( a_i = a_{n-i} \) for all \( i = 0, 1, \ldots, n \). This implies the polynomial has a symmetry about its middle term(s).

**Step 5:**
Fourth, the condition \( \gcd(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n) = 1 \) implies that the polynomial cannot have a common factor among all its coefficients. This constraint will help us filter out cases where all coefficients share a common divisor other than 1.

**Step 6:**
Fifth, given the constraints above, we can count the number of polynomials by considering the possible values for \( a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n \) under the conditions of symmetry and coprimality.

**Step 7:**
Sixth, for a polynomial of degree \( n \), there are \( \lfloor \frac{n+1}{2} \rfloor \) unique coefficients (because of the symmetry) we need to determine. For each of these coefficients, we can choose any integer value except 0 (to ensure \( \gcd(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n) = 1 \)), and the rest of the coefficients are determined by the symmetry.

**Step 8:**
Given the bounds on \( n \) (\( 1 \leq n \leq 7 \)), let's calculate the number of such polynomials for each \( n \):

**Step 9:**
For \( n=1 \):
- There is only one non-zero coefficient (since \( a_0 \neq 0 \)), so there is 1 polynomial.

**Step 10:**
For \( n=2 \):
- There are two coefficients \( a_0 \) and \( a_1 \) (with \( a_2 = a_0 \)), and they must be coprime. There are infinitely many pairs of coprime integers, but since we are only counting distinct polynomials, we only consider positive values (since negative values would result in the same polynomial when squared). Thus, there are infinitely many polynomials, but practically, we look for positive coprime pairs which is not easily quantifiable without further constraints.

**Step 11:**
For \( n=3 \):
- There are two coefficients \( a_0 \) and \( a_1 \) (with \( a_3 = a_0 \), \( a_2 = a_1 \)). Similar to the case of \( n=2 \), but here we are looking for coprime triples \( (a_0, a_1, a_0) \), which again results in an infinite set.

**Step 12:**
For \( n=4 \):
- There are three coefficients \( a_0 \), \( a_1 \), and \( a_2 \) (with \( a_4 = a_0 \), \( a_3 = a_1 \)). Again, we are looking for coprime quadruples \( (a_0, a_1, a_2, a_0) \), leading to a large but finite number of possibilities.

**Step 13:**
For \( n=5 \):
- There are three coefficients \( a_0 \), \( a_1 \), and \( a_2 \) (with \( a_5 = a_0 \), \( a_4 = a_1 \), \( a_3 = a_2 \)). Similar to \( n=4 \), but now looking at quintuples.

**Step 14:**
For \( n=6 \):
- There are four coefficients \( a_0 \), \( a_1 \), \( a_2 \), and \( a_3 \) (with \( a_6 = a_0 \), \( a_5 = a_1 \), \( a_4 = a_2 \)). We are looking for coprime sextuples.

**Step 15:**
For \( n=7 \):
- There are four coefficients \( a_0 \), \( a_1 \), \( a_2 \), and \( a_3 \) (with \( a_7 = a_0 \), \( a_6 = a_1 \), \( a_5 = a_2 \), \( a_4 = a_3 \)). Similar to \( n=6 \), but now looking at septuples.

**Step 16:**
However, for practical computation, especially considering the bounds of \( 1 \leq n \leq 7 \), we need to find a method to systematically count the number of coprime tuples for each \( n \). Unfortunately, due to the complexity of counting coprime tuples up to septuples, we might need to use combinatorial or number-theoretic methods to accurately count the number of such polynomials. For a complete solution within the scope of this format, the exact enumeration of such polynomials for \( n > 2 \) requires advanced techniques beyond simple counting, involving considerations of number theory and combinatorics, which is beyond the scope of this response.

**Step 17:**
Therefore, the direct answer to the problem, considering the complexity and requirements for enumeration beyond \( n=1 \), leads to a conclusion that the problem does not have a straightforward numerical answer that can be provided succinctly. However, if we were to provide an answer based on the principle outlined, for degrees \( n=1 \) to \( n=7 \), the direct counting becomes impractical past \( n=1 \) without additional constraints or specific computational methods designed for such problems.

**Step 18:**
In conclusion, for \( n=1 \), there is 1 polynomial satisfying the given conditions, and for higher degrees, the problem transforms into a complex combinatorial and number-theoretic question, the exact answer to which depends on detailed analysis that goes beyond the scope of this explanation. The final answer to the problem, within the constraints given, for \( n=1 \) is \(\boxed{1}\), acknowledging that for higher degrees, a precise numerical answer requires advanced mathematical techniques and computational resources.
