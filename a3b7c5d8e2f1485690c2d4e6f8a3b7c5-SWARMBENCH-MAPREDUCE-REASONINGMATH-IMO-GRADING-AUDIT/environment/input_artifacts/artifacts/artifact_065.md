## Problem

Let $p$ be a prime number and $a, b$ be positive integers such that

 \[
 p^{n}=a^{4}+b^{4}
 \]

 for some integer $n \geq 2$. Prove that $n \geq 5$.

## Reference Solution (for grader's calibration)

First, let's summarize the facts that are frequently used in Diophantine equations. We will omit the proofs of well-known facts. The following lemma characterizes Pythagorean triples and is used repeatedly.

 <Lemma 1> If $a, b, c$ are positive integers with $ab \neq 0$ satisfying $a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$, then there exist positive integers $m \neq n$ and $k$ such that

 \[
 (a, b, c)=k\left(2 m n, m^{2}-n^{2}, m^{2}+n^{2}\right) \text { or } k\left(m^{2}-n^{2}, 2 m n, m^{2}+n^{2}\right).
 \]

 In particular, if $a, b$ are relatively prime, then $k=1$ and $m$ and $n$ have different parity, and one of $a, b$ is odd and the other is even. The odd one is expressed as $m^{2}-n^{2}$ and the even one is expressed as $2mn$. Also, in this case, $c$ is always odd.
 <Proof of Lemma 1> Omitted. \qed
 <Lemma 2> If $p$ is a prime number or 1, and positive integers $x$ and relatively prime positive integers $a, b$ satisfy

 \[
 p a b=x^{2},
 \]

 then there exist positive integers $u, v$ such that $(a, b, x)=\left(p u^{2}, v^{2}, p u v\right)$ or $\left(u^{2}, p v^{2}, p u v\right)$.
 <Proof of Lemma 2> Omitted. \qed

 <Lemma 3> If $a^{2}+b^{2}$ is a multiple of 4 for integers $a, b$, then both $a$ and $b$ are even.

 <Proof of Lemma 3> $a$ and $b$ must have the same parity, but the square of an odd number has a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, so if $a, b$ have the same parity as odd numbers, then $a^{2}+b^{2}$ has a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, so it cannot be a multiple of 4. \qed

 Now, let's proceed with the proof of the main problem using these facts.
 <Step 1> There are no positive integers $x, y, z$ satisfying $x^{4}+y^{4}=z^{2}$. Therefore, $n$ is odd.

 <Step 1.1> Using proof by contradiction, assume that there exists a positive integer solution $x, y, z$. Among these solutions, choose the solution $(x, y, z)$ with the smallest $z$. If there is a prime number $q$ that divides two of $x, y, z$, then it must also divide the remaining number, and in this case, $\left(\frac{x}{q}, \frac{y}{q}, \frac{z}{q^{2}}\right)$ becomes a solution, contradicting the minimality of $z$. Therefore, this solution is pairwise relatively prime.

 <Step 1.2> Since $\left(x^{2}, y^{2}, z\right)$ is a Pythagorean triple, by <Lemma 1>, there exist relatively prime positive integers $u, v$ with different parity such that


 \begin{equation*}
 x^{2}=u^{2}-v^{2}, y^{2}=2 u v, z=u^{2}+v^{2} \tag{1.1}
 \end{equation*}


 We can assume that $u > v$ without loss of generality. Since $y^{2}=2 u v$ and $u, v$ are relatively prime, by <Lemma 2>, there exist positive integers $s, t$ such that $u=2 s^{2}, v=t^{2}$ or $u=s^{2}, v=2 t^{2}$.

 (Case 1) $u=2 s^{2}, v=t^{2}$

 $x^{2}+t^{4}=4 s^{4}$. By <Lemma 3>, both $x$ and $t$ must be even, but from $x^{2}=u^{2}-v^{2}$, $x$ is odd, which is a contradiction.

 (Case 2) $u=s^{2}, v=2 t^{2}$

 $x^{2}+4 t^{4}=s^{4}$ and since $t|v, v| y^{2}$,

 \[
 \operatorname{gcd}(x, t)|\operatorname{gcd}(x, v)| \operatorname{gcd}\left(x, y^{2}\right)=1.
 \]

 Therefore, $x$ and $t^{2}$ are also relatively prime, and by <Lemma 1>, there exist relatively prime positive integers $q, r$ with different parity (since $x$ is odd by (1.1)) such that

 \[
 x=q^{2}-r^{2}, 2 t^{2}=2 q r, s^{2}=q^{2}+r^{2}.
 \]

 Since $t^{2}=q r$, by <Lemma 2>, there exist positive integers $x', y'$ such that $q=x^{\prime 2}, r=y^{\prime 2}$, and thus by the above equation, $x^{\prime 4}+y^{\prime 4}=s^{2}$. Since

 \[
 s=\sqrt{u} \leq u<u^{2}+v^{2}=z,
 \]

 this contradicts the minimality of $(x, y, z)$. Therefore, the proof is complete.

 <Step 2> If $p^{3}=a^{4}+b^{4}$, then there exist positive integers $x, y, z$ such that $x^{2}+3 y^{4}=z^{4}$.

 <Step 2.1> If $p \mid a$, then clearly $p \mid b$ must also hold, and vice versa. Therefore, $a, b$ are either both multiples of $p$ or not. However, if the former is the case, the right-hand side becomes a multiple of $p^{4}$, which is a contradiction, so $p$ is relatively prime to both $a$ and $b$.

 <Step 2.2> Therefore, $p$ is a divisor of the sum of squares, and since $(p, a)=(p, b)=1$, $p$ is a prime number of the form $4 k+1$, so it can be expressed in the form $p=c^{2}+d^{2}$. By Jacobi's theorem, there are only two ways (considering order) to express $p^{3}$ as the sum of perfect squares:

 \[
 (p c)^{2}+(p d)^{2} \text { and } \left(c\left(c^{2}-3 d^{2}\right)\right)^{2}+\left(d\left(3 c^{2}-d^{2}\right)\right)^{2}.
 \]

 By (1), the first case cannot be expressed as $a^{4}+b^{4}$, so

 \[
 a^{2}=\left|c\left(c^{2}-3 d^{2}\right)\right|, \quad b^{2}=\left|d\left(3 c^{2}-d^{2}\right)\right|
 \]

 (or vice versa, but we can ignore this case due to symmetry) must hold. Letting $C=|c|, D=|d|$, we have


 \begin{equation*}
 a^{2} b^{2}=C D \times\left|C^{2}-3 D^{2}\right| \times\left|3 C^{2}-D^{2}\right| \tag{1.2}
 \end{equation*}


 and $\operatorname{gcd}(C, D)=1$. Now, we divide into cases depending on whether $C D$ is a multiple of 3.

 (Case 1) If $3 \mid C D$

 Without loss of generality, assume $3 \mid C$. Then, from

 \[
 \left(\frac{a b}{3}\right)^{2}=\frac{C}{3} \cdot D \cdot\left|3\left(\frac{C}{3}\right)^{2}-D^{2}\right| \cdot\left|3 C^{2}-D^{2}\right|,
 \]

 since the four terms are pairwise relatively prime, there exist positive integers $e, f, g, h$ such that

 \[
 C=3 e^{2}, \quad D=f^{2},\left|3 e^{4}-f^{4}\right|=g^{2},\left|27 e^{4}-f^{4}\right|=h^{2}.
 \]

 Then, by $\bmod 3$, we have $g^{2}+3 e^{4}=f^{4}$.

 (Case 2) If $3 \nmid CD$

 From (1.2), since the four terms are pairwise relatively prime, there exist positive integers $e, f, g, h$ such that

 \[
 C=e^{2}, \quad D=f^{2},\left|e^{4}-3 f^{4}\right|=g^{2},\left|3 e^{4}-f^{4}\right|=h^{2}.
 \]

 Similarly, by $\bmod 3$, we have $e^{4}-3 f^{4}=g^{2}$.

 Therefore, in both cases, there exists a positive integer solution to $x^{2}+3 y^{4}=z^{4}$.

 <Step 3> There are no positive integers $x, y, z$ satisfying $x^{2}+3 y^{4}=z^{4}$.

 Using proof by contradiction, assume that there exists a positive integer solution $x, y, z$. Among these solutions, choose the solution $(x, y, z)$ with the smallest $z$. If there is a prime number $q$ that divides two of $x, y, z$, then it must also divide the remaining number, and in this case, $\left(\frac{x}{q^{2}}, \frac{y}{q}, \frac{z}{q}\right)$ becomes a solution, contradicting the minimality of $z$. Therefore, this solution is pairwise relatively prime.

 Now, rewriting the equation as


 \begin{equation*}
 3 y^{4}=\left(z^{2}-x\right)\left(z^{2}+x\right) \tag{1.3}
 \end{equation*}


 we can divide into two cases since $\operatorname{gcd}\left(z^{2}-x, z^{2}+x\right)=1$ or 2.

 (Case 1) If $x$ and $z$ have the same parity

 By <Lemma 2>, there exist relatively prime positive integers $u, v$ such that

 \[
 z^{2}-x=2 u^{2}, z^{2}+x=6 v^{2}, y^{2}=2 u v \quad \text { or } \quad z^{2}+x=2 u^{2}, z^{2}-x=6 v^{2}, y^{2}=2 u v.
 \]

 In both cases, we have


 \begin{equation*}
 z^{2}=u^{2}+3 v^{2}, y^{2}=2 u v. \tag{1.4}
 \end{equation*}


 Since $y$ is even, one of $u, v$ must be even.

 <Step 3.1> If $u$ is even, then $v$ is odd, and then $z^{2}=u^{2}+3 v^{2} \equiv 3(\bmod 4)$, which is a contradiction.

 <Step 3.2> If $v$ is even, then by <Lemma 2>, there exist positive integers $s, t$ such that

 \[
 u=s^{2}, v=2 t^{2},
 \]

 and substituting this back into (1.4) gives $s^{4}+12 t^{4}=z^{2}$. Since both $s$ and $z$ are odd, this equation can be written as

 \[
 \frac{z+s^{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{z-s^{2}}{2}=3 t^{4},
 \]

 and since $\operatorname{gcd}\left(\frac{z+s^{2}}{2}, \frac{z-s^{2}}{2}\right)=1$, by <Lemma 2>, there exist relatively prime positive integers $q, r$ such that

 \[
 \frac{z+s^{2}}{2}=q^{4}, \frac{z-s^{2}}{2}=3 r^{4} \quad \text { or } \quad \frac{z+s^{2}}{2}=3 r^{4}, \frac{z-s^{2}}{2}=q^{4}.
 \]

 In the second case, we have $s^{2}=3 r^{4}-q^{4}$, but since $q$ and $s$ cannot both be multiples of 3 (in this case, $r$ would also be a multiple of 3, leading to a contradiction), $s^{2}+q^{4}$ cannot be a multiple of 3, which is a contradiction. In the remaining case, we have $s^{2}=q^{4}-3 r^{4}$, but since $q \leq q^{4} = \frac{z+s^2}{2} < z$, this contradicts the minimality of $z$.

 (Case 2) If $x$ and $z$ have different parity

 In this case, by (1.3) and <Lemma 2>, there exist relatively prime positive integers $u, v$ such that

 \[
 z^{2}+x=u^{4}, z^{2}-x=3 v^{4}, y^{2}=u v \quad \text { or } \quad z^{2}-x=3 v^{4}, z^{2}+x=u^{4}, y^{2}=u v.
 \]

 In both cases, we have $2 z^{2}=u^{4}+3 v^{4}$, but since $z$ and $u$ cannot both be multiples of 3, this leads to a contradiction modulo 3.

 Therefore, by <Step 1>, $n \neq 2,4$, and by <Step 2>, $n \neq 3$, so the proof is complete.

## Candidate Response (to be graded)

We are given the equation $p^n = a^4 + b^4$, where $p$ is a prime number, $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, and $n \geq 2$. We want to prove that $n \geq 5$.

### Step 1: Reduction to a Primitive Equation

Let $d = \gcd(a, b)$. Since $d^4$ divides $a^4+b^4 = p^n$, $d$ must be a power of $p$. Let $d = p^k$ for some integer $k \geq 0$.
We can write $a = p^k A$ and $b = p^k B$, where $A$ and $B$ are positive integers such that $\gcd(A, B) = 1$.

Substituting these into the equation:
$p^n = (p^k A)^4 + (p^k B)^4 = p^{4k}(A^4 + B^4)$.

Let $N = n-4k$. Dividing by $p^{4k}$, we get the primitive equation:
\[ p^N = A^4 + B^4, \quad \text{with } \gcd(A, B) = 1. \]
Since $A, B \geq 1$, $A^4+B^4 \geq 1^4+1^4 = 2$. Thus $p^N \geq 2$, which implies $N \geq 1$.
The original exponent is $n = N + 4k$. We are given $n \geq 2$.

We analyze the constraints on $N$.

### Step 2: $N$ must be odd

We use a fundamental result proven by Fermat:

**Theorem 1 (Fermat):** The Diophantine equation $X^4 + Y^4 = Z^2$ has no solutions in positive integers $X, Y, Z$.

Suppose $N$ is even. Let $N=2m$ for some integer $m \geq 1$.
$A^4 + B^4 = p^{2m} = (p^m)^2$.
Since $A, B, p^m$ are positive integers, this contradicts Theorem 1.
Therefore, $N$ must be odd. $N \in \{1, 3, 5, \dots\}$.

### Step 3: The Case $p=2$

If $p=2$, the primitive equation is $2^N = A^4 + B^4$, with $\gcd(A, B)=1$.

Since $N \geq 1$, $A^4+B^4$ is even. As $A$ and $B$ are coprime, they must both be odd.

We analyze the equation modulo 16. For any odd integer $X$, $X^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{16}$.
$A^4 + B^4 \equiv 1 + 1 = 2 \pmod{16}$.

We must have $2^N \equiv 2 \pmod{16}$.
If $N \geq 4$, $2^N \equiv 0 \pmod{16}$.
If $N=3$, $2^3=8$. If $N=2$, $2^2=4$.
The only possibility is $N=1$. (This corresponds to $A=1, B=1$).

If $p=2$, then $N=1$. We examine $n$:
$n = N + 4k = 1 + 4k$.
We are given $n \geq 2$. Thus, $1 + 4k \geq 2$, which means $4k \geq 1$.
Since $k$ is an integer, we must have $k \geq 1$.
Therefore, $n = 1 + 4k \geq 1 + 4(1) = 5$.

### Step 4: The Case $p>2$ ($p$ is an odd prime)

We know $N$ must be odd. We need to show that $N \neq 3$.

**Lemma:** The equation $A^4+B^4=Z^3$ has no solutions in coprime positive integers $A, B, Z$ where $Z>1$. In particular, $A^4+B^4=p^3$ has no such solutions.

*Proof of Lemma:*
Assume $A^4+B^4=p^3$ has a solution with $\gcd(A, B)=1$ and $p$ an odd prime.

If $p=3$, $A^4+B^4=27$. Since $1^4=1, 2^4=16, 3^4=81$, the only possibilities are $1+16=17$ or $16+1=17$. No solutions. Assume $p \neq 3$.

We factor in the Gaussian integers $\mathbb{Z}[i]$: $p^3 = (A^2+iB^2)(A^2-iB^2)$.
Since $p$ is odd and $\gcd(A, B)=1$, $\gcd(A^2+iB^2, A^2-iB^2)=1$ in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$.
Since $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a UFD and the product is a cube, $A^2+iB^2$ must be associated with a cube. Since all units in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ are cubes, $A^2+iB^2$ is a cube:
$A^2+iB^2 = (x+iy)^3$ for some integers $x, y$.

Taking norms, $A^4+B^4 = p^3 = (x^2+y^2)^3$, which implies $p = x^2+y^2$.
Since $p$ is prime, $\gcd(x,
