## Problem

Let $n$ be a positive integer that has a remainder of 6 when divided by 7. Let $d$ be any divisor of $n$.

Define $c$ such that when the expression $\left(d+\frac{n}{d}\right)^{2}$ is divided by $n$, the remainder is $n-c$.

What is the smallest possible value of $c$ among all $d$ and $n$ satisfying the conditions above?

(Note that the remainder when a positive integer $a$ is divided by a positive integer $b$ is the value of $r$ in the expression $a=b q+r, 0 \leq r \leq b-1$.)

## Reference Solution (for grader's calibration)

<Step 1> Understanding the problem situation

 <Step 1.1> Let $d=a, \frac{n}{d}=b$, then $n=a b$. So if the remainder when $(a+b)^{2}$ is divided by $n$ is $n-c$ (where $c \geq 1$), then

 \[
 -c \equiv(a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}+2 a b \equiv a^{2}+b^{2}(\bmod n)
 \]

 which implies that $\frac{a^{2}+b^{2}+c}{a b}$ must be a positive integer.

 <Step 1.2> First, if $c=3$, then setting $a=4, b=19$ gives

 \[
 \frac{4^{2}+19^{2}+3}{4 \cdot 19}=5
 \]

 which is an integer. In fact, this corresponds to the case when $n=76, d=4$, and $\left(4+\frac{76}{4}\right)^{2}=529 \equiv -3(\bmod 76)$.

 <Step 1.3> Therefore, if $c \leq 2$, it is sufficient to prove that when $\frac{a^{2}+b^{2}+c}{a b}$ is a positive integer, $n$ cannot have remainder 6 when divided by $7$. Now, let's assume that $c$ is 1 or 2.

 <Step 2> Vieta jumping

 <Step 2.1> First, let's find the solutions when $a=b$. Then $\frac{2 a^{2}+c}{a^{2}}$ must be a positive integer, so $a^{2} \mid c$. Since $c$ is 1 or 2, we know that $a=1$. Therefore, $(a, b)=(1,1)$ is the only solution in this case. Now, let's find the solutions when $a \neq b$. By symmetry, we can assume $a<b$, so let's find all such pairs $(a, b)$.

 <Step 2.2> We need to find pairs $(a, b)$ that satisfy the following for some positive integer $k$:


 \begin{equation*}
 \frac{a^{2}+b^{2}+c}{a b}=k \tag{1.1}
 \end{equation*}


 The above equation (1.1) can be rewritten as:

 \[
 a^{2}-k a b+b^{2}+c=0
 \]

 Now, if we view this equation as a quadratic equation in $b$, we can observe the following facts from the relationship between roots and coefficients:

 (1) The sum of the two roots is $k a$, so if a positive integer $b$ is a root, then the other root is $k a-b$, which is also an integer.

 (2) The product of the two roots is $a^{2}+c$, so if a positive integer $b$ is a root, then $\frac{a^{2}+c}{b}$ is also a root, and by (1), it is a positive integer solution.

 (2) Therefore, if $(a, b)$ is a solution to (1.1), then


 \begin{equation*}
 \left(a^{\prime}, b^{\prime}\right)=\left(\frac{a^{2}+c}{b}, a\right)=(k a-b, a) \tag{1.2}
 \end{equation*}


 defined as above is also a solution to (1.1).

 This process gives us a way to find another solution if we have a solution $(a, b)$.

 <Step 3> Applying the method of infinite descent

 Suppose $(a, b)$ is a solution to (1.1) with $a<b$. Now, let's apply infinite descent to the recursive construction process of solutions described in <Step 2> .

 <Step 3.1> Since we assumed $a<b$,

 \[
 b^{2} \geq(a+1)^{2}>a^{2}+2 \geq a^{2}+c
 \]

 so $\frac{a^{2}+c}{b}<b$. In other words, from (1.2),

 \[
 a^{\prime}+b^{\prime}=\frac{a^{2}+c}{b}+a<a+b
 \]

 holds. That is, when performing the recursive construction in <Step 1>, the sum of the two numbers forming the solution always decreases by at least 1.

 <Step 3.2> If $\frac{a^{2}+c}{b}<a$, we can apply the process in <Step 1> again to the new solution $\left(a^{\prime}, b^{\prime}\right)=\left(\frac{a^{2}+c}{b}, a\right)$ to obtain another solution. However, by the result in (1) and the principle of infinite descent, this process cannot be repeated infinitely, and we will eventually reach a solution $(a, b)$ that satisfies $\frac{a^{2}+c}{b} \geq a$.

 <Step 3.3> Let's find what the final solution we must reach in (2) is. If $a<b$, then $b \geq a+1$ must hold. In this situation, if $\frac{a^{2}+c}{b} \geq a$, then

 \[
 a^{2}+c \geq a b \geq a(a+1)=a^{2}+a
 \]

 so $a \leq c$ must hold. Since $a$ is a positive integer, only $a=1,2$ are possible. Here, if $a=2$, then all equalities in the above inequality must hold, so $b=a+1=3$ and $c=2$, which gives

 \[
 \frac{a^{2}+b^{2}+c}{a b}=\frac{2^{2}+3^{2}+3}{2 \cdot 3}=\frac{8}{3}
 \]

 which is not an integer. Therefore, $a$ must be 1 in any case, and $\frac{a^{2}+c}{b}=\frac{1+c}{b}$ must be an integer.$b>a$ and $c+1=2or3$ so $b=c+1$.

 Therefore, this process ends when $(1, c+1)$ becomes $\left(\frac{1^{2}+c}{c+1}, 1\right)=(1,1)$.

 <Step 3.4> Summarizing the above discussion, if $(a, b)$ is a solution to (1.1) with $a<b$, then $\left(a^{\prime}, b^{\prime}\right)$ obtained in <Step 1> is a new solution satisfying $a^{\prime}<b^{\prime}$, and this process of generating solutions ends when the solution reaches $(1,1)$.

 <Step 4> Reversing the descent process

 <Step 4.1> First, the value of $k$ in (1.1) does not change during the process described in <Step 3> . Therefore, the value of $k$ must be the same as the value at the endpoint $(a, b)=(1,1)$ of this process, so

 \[
 k=\frac{1^{2}+1^{2}+1}{c \cdot 1}=c+2
 \]

 must hold.

 <Step 4.2> Now, we know that any solution $(a, b)$ to (1.1) with $a<b$ reaches the endpoint $(a, b)=(1,1)$ by going through the process described in <Step 3> . Therefore, by reversing this process, we can find all solutions $(a, b)$ to (1.1) with $a<b$.

 <Step 4.3> On the other hand, from (1), $k=c+2$, so looking at (1.2), we see that $\left(a^{\prime}, b^{\prime}\right)=((c+2) a-b, a)$. Therefore,

 \[
 (a, b)=\left(b^{\prime},(c+2) b^{\prime}-a^{\prime}\right)
 \]

 holds. In other words, the process of mapping $(x, y) \mapsto(y,(c+2) y-x)$ is the reverse of the process where the solution descends in <Step 2> .

 <Step 4.4> Therefore, by (3), if we define the sequence $\left(x_{n}, y_{n}\right)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ as $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)=(1,1)$ and

 \begin{equation} \tag{1.3}
 \left\{\begin{array}{l}
 x_{n+1}=y_{n}

 y_{n+1}=(c+2) y_{n}-x_{n}
 \end{array}\right.
 \end{equation}

 then this sequence describes the reverse of the process where the solution descends in <Step 2>, and by (2), these $\left(x_{n}, y_{n}\right)$ with $n \geq 2$ are all solutions to (1.1) with $a<b$.

 Note that the descent process described in <Step 2> is

 \[
 \left(x_{k}, y_{k}\right) \rightarrow\left(x_{k-1}, y_{k-1}\right) \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)=(1,1)
 \]

 <Step 4.5>

 (Case 1) When $c=1$, substituting the first equation of (1.3) into the second equation gives the recurrence relation

 \[
 y_{n+1}=3 y_{n}-y_{n-1}
 \]

 and using $y_{1}=1, y_{2}=2$, we can see that this sequence repeats as $1,2,5,6,6,5,2,1,1,2$ modulo 7. Therefore, $x_n y_{n} = y_n y_{n-1}$ repeats as $2,3,2,1,2,3,2,1$ and thus cannot have remainder 6 when devided by $7$.

 (Case 2) When $c=2$, substituting the first equation of (1.3) into the second equation gives the recurrence relation

 \[
 y_{n+1}=4 y_{n}-y_{n-1}
 \]

 and using $y_{1}=1, y_{2}=3$, we can see that this sequence repeats as $1,3,4,6,6,4,3,1,1,3$ modulo 7. Therefore, $x_n y_{n} = y_n y_{n-1}$ repeats as $3,5,3,1,3,5,3,1$ and thus cannot have remainder 6 when divided by $7$.

 In conclusion, when $c=1,2$, there is no case where $ab$ has remainder $6$ when divided by $7$ and $\frac{a^{2}+b^{2}+c}{a b}$ is an integer. Therefore, $c=3$ is the smallest possible value.

## Candidate Response (to be graded)

Here is a step-by-step solution.

**1. Setting up the Mathematical Framework**

We are given a positive integer $n$ such that $n \equiv 6 \pmod 7$. Let $d$ be a divisor of $n$, and let $k = n/d$. Both $d$ and $k$ are positive integers, and $n=dk$.

We are considering the expression $E = \left(d+\frac{n}{d}\right)^{2} = (d+k)^2$.
$E = d^2 + 2dk + k^2 = d^2 + k^2 + 2n$.

We are given that the remainder $R$ when $E$ is divided by $n$ is $n-c$.
$E \equiv R \pmod n$.
$d^2 + k^2 + 2n \equiv n-c \pmod n$.
$d^2 + k^2 \equiv -c \pmod n$.

This means that $d^2 + k^2 + c$ is a positive multiple of $n=dk$. Let $Q$ be a positive integer such that:
$d^2 + k^2 + c = Qdk$.

We are looking for the smallest positive integer $c$ such that there exist positive integers $d, k, Q$ satisfying this equation, with the constraint $n = dk \equiv 6 \pmod 7$.

**2. Analyzing the Case c = 1**

We examine the equation $d^2 + k^2 + 1 = Qdk$.

We first determine the possible integer values for $Q$.
If $d=k$, then $2d^2+1 = Qd^2$, so $Q = 2 + 1/d^2$. For $Q$ to be an integer, $d^2$ must divide 1, so $d=k=1$. This gives $Q=3$.

If $d \ne k$, we can use the method of Vieta jumping. If $(d, k)$ is a solution for a fixed $Q$, then any solution can be reached from a fundamental solution by repeatedly applying the Vieta root transformation. For $c=1$, the fundamental solutions (where $d \le k$ and the other root $k'=(d^2+1)/k$ satisfies $k' \ge d$) are $(1, 1)$ and $(1, 2)$.
For $(1, 1)$, $Q=(1+1+1)/(1\cdot 1) = 3$.
For $(1, 2)$, $Q=(1+4+1)/(1\cdot 2) = 3$.
Thus, the only possible integer value for $Q$ when $c=1$ is $Q=3$.

The solutions $(d, k)$ to $d^2 + k^2 + 1 = 3dk$ are pairs of consecutive terms in the sequence $\{a_i\}$ defined by $a_0=1, a_1=1$, and $a_{i+1} = 3a_i - a_{i-1}$.

We must check the constraint $n = dk \equiv 6 \pmod 7$. We analyze the sequence $a_i$ modulo 7:
$a_{i+1} \equiv 3a_i - a_{i-1} \pmod 7$.
$a_i \pmod 7$: 1, 1, 2, $3(2)-1=5$, $3(5)-2=13\equiv 6$, $3(6)-5=13\equiv 6$, 5, 2, 1, 1, ...
The sequence is periodic: (1, 1, 2, 5, 6, 6, 5, 2).

We examine the products $n = a_i a_{i+1} \pmod 7$:
$1\cdot 1 = 1$
$1\cdot 2 = 2$
$2\cdot 5 = 10 \equiv 3$
$5\cdot 6 = 30 \equiv 2$
$6\cdot 6 = 36 \equiv 1$
The possible values for $n \pmod 7$ are $\{1, 2, 3\}$. Since $n \equiv 6 \pmod 7$ is required, $c=1$ is impossible.

**3. Analyzing the Case c = 2**

We examine the equation $d^2 + k^2 + 2 = Qdk$.

We determine the possible integer values for $Q$.
If $d=k$, $Q = 2 + 2/d^2$. $d^2$ must divide 2, so $d=k=1$. This gives $Q=4$.
If $d=1$, $Q = (1+k^2+2)/k = k + 3/k$. $k$ must divide 3. $k=1$ or $k=3$. In both cases, $Q=4$.

Using Vieta jumping, we can verify that $Q=4$ is the only possible integer value for $c=2$.

The solutions $(d, k)$ to $d^2 + k^2 + 2 = 4dk$ are pairs of consecutive terms in the sequence $\{b_i\}$ defined by $b_0=1, b_1=1$, and $b_{i+1} = 4b_i - b_{i-1}$.

We analyze $b_i \pmod 7$:
$b_{i+1} \equiv 4b_i - b_{i-1} \pmod 7$.
$b_i \pmod 7$: 1, 1, 3, $4(3)-1=11\
