## Problem

Let $ ABC $ be an acute triangle which is not an isosceles.Let $ I $ be the incenter and let $ \omega $ be the circumcircle of $ABC$. Let the intersections of lines $ AI $, $ BI $, and $ CI $ with $ BC $, $ CA $, and $ AB $ be $ D $, $ E $, and $ F $ respectively. Also, let $ \omega_A $ be the circle that lies inside $\angle BAC$, tangent to lines $ AB $ and $ AC $, and internally tangent to the circumcircle $ \omega $ at $ T_A $. Similarly, define $ T_B $ and $ T_C $ for points $ B $ and $ C $ respectively. Prove that there exist two points $ X $ and $ Y $ such that the circumcircles of triangles $ ADT_A $, $ BET_B $, and $ CFT_C $ all pass through $ X $ and $ Y $.

## Reference Solution (for grader's calibration)

Let's define some points as follows:
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Let $A_1$, $B_1$, and $C_1$ be the points of tangency of the incircle with sides $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$, respectively.
  \item Let $N$ be the midpoint of arc $BC$.
  \item Let $S_A$ be the intersection of line $NT_A$ and side $BC$ (if they are parallel, consider $S_A$ as the point at infinity).
  \item Let $\Gamma_A$, $\Gamma_B$, and $\Gamma_C$ be the circumcircles of triangles $ADT$, $BET$, and $CFT$, respectively.
 \end{enumerate}

 <Step 1> Finding a point on the radical axis of circles $\Gamma_A$, $\Gamma_B$, and $\Gamma_C$

 By the well-known property of Mixtilinear circles, $AT_A$ is isogonal to the line joining the point of tangency of the excircle opposite to vertex $A$ and vertex $A$.
 Similarly, consider the lines joining the points of tangency of the excircles opposite to vertices $B$ and $C$ with their respective vertices. It is well-known that these three lines intersect at a single point, the Nagel point.
 Therefore, lines $AT_A$, $BT_B$, and $CT_C$ also intersect at a single point, which is the isogonal conjugate of the Nagel point. Let this point be $T$.
 Clearly, $T$ lies on segments $AT_A$, $BT_B$, and $CT_C$, and is inside circles $\Gamma_A$, $\Gamma_B$, and $\Gamma_C$.

 Furthermore, by the power of a point theorem with respect to the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$, we have
 \[AT \cdot TT_A = BT \cdot TT_B = CT \cdot TT_C.\]
 Therefore, point $T$ has the same power with respect to circles $\Gamma_A$, $\Gamma_B$, and $\Gamma_C.$

 Hence, to prove the statement, it is sufficient to find another point that has the same power with respect to circles $\Gamma_A$, $\Gamma_B$, and $\Gamma_C$.

 <Step 2> $(A, D, T_A, S_A)$ is cyclic

 $\angle ADS_A = \frac{\angle A}{2} + \angle C = \angle ACN = \angle A T_A SA$, so $(A, D, T_A, S_A)$ is cyclic.

 <Step 3> $\angle AIS_A = 90^\circ$

 This is also a well-known property of Mixtilinear circles. By angle chasing, we can show that the circumcircles of triangles $BIC$ and $NIT_A$ are tangent to each other at point $I$.
 Let's consider the radical axes of these three circles:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item The radical axis of the circumcircles of triangles $BIC$ and $NITA$ is the line passing through $I$ and perpendicular to $AI$.
  \item The radical axis of the circumcircles of triangles $BIC$ and $ABC$ is $BC$.
  \item The radical axis of the circumcircles of triangles $ABC$ and $NITA$ is $NT_A$.
 \end{itemize}
 Therefore, the intersection point $S_A$ of $BC$ and $NT_A$ satisfies $\angle AIS_A = 90^\circ$.

 <Step 4> Inversion with respect to the incircle of triangle $ABC$

 Now, let's invert the figure with respect to the incircle $I$. In particular, let's pay attention to which circle $I$ maps to under this inversion.
 Let $A'$, $B'$, and $C'$ be the images of points $A$, $B$, and $C$ under the inversion. Also, let $D'$ and $S_A'$ be the images of points $D$ and $S_A$ under the inversion.

 Let's investigate the properties of the inverted points.
 Since $DA_1$ is tangent to the circle, $D'$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $A_1$ to $ID$. $A'$ is the midpoint of $B_1C_1$. Finally, since $SA_1$ is tangent to the circle, $S_A'$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $A_1$ to $IS_A$.
 By the conclusion of Step 3, $A_1S_A'$ is parallel to $AI$.
 By the observation from step 2, the inversion of the circumcircle of $ADT_A$ is the circumcircle of triangle $A'S_A'D'$. Similarly, the circumcircles of $B'S_B'E'$ and $C'S_C'F'$ are our desired circles. Let's prove that the three circumcircles pass through two common points.

 <Step 5> The circumcircles of triangles $A'S_A'D', B'S_B'E'$, and $C'S_C'F'$ pass through two common points

 Now, let's consider the figure with respect to triangle $A_1B_1C_1$.

 In triangle $A_1B_1C_1$, point $I$ is the circumcenter. Let $H_1$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $A_1$ to $B_1C_1$.
 Then, points $A'$, $S_A'$, and $D'$ are constructed as follows:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Point $A'$ is the midpoint of $B_1C_1$.
  \item Point $D'$ is the intersection of the line parallel to $B_1C_1$ passing through $A_1$ and the perpendicular bisector of $B_1C_1$.
  \item Point $S_A'$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $I$ to $AH_1$.
 \end{itemize}
 Through this construction, we can find that the circumcenter $O_A$ of triangle $A'S_A'D'$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $A'D'$, which is the line $B'C'$.
 Now, let's consider the point $O_A'$ which is the reflection of $O_A$ with respect to the midpoint of $B'C'$.

 <Step 6> $O_A'$ is the circumcenter of triangle $A_1IH_1$

 Since $A'$, $B'$, $C'$, and $H_1$ lie on the nine-point circle of triangle $ABC$, these four points are concyclic. Therefore, quadrilateral $A'H_1 B'C'$ is an isosceles trapezoid, and points $A'$ and $H_1$ are symmetric with respect to the perpendicular bisector of line $B_1 C_1$.
 Furthermore, $A_1$ and $D'$ are symmetric with respect to the perpendicular bisector of line $B'C'$.
 Therefore, triangle $AIH_1$ is the reflection of triangle $A'S_A'D'$ across the perpendicular bisector of line $B'C'$, and the circumcenters $O_A$ and $O_A'$ are also symmetric with respect to each other.

 <Step 7> $O_A, O_B$, and $O_C$ are collinear

 Now, let's define $O_B, O_C, O_B'$, and $O_C'$ similarly, and show that $O_A, O_B$, and $O_C$ are collinear.
 First, let's show that $O_A'$, $O_B'$, and $O_C'$ are collinear. It is sufficient to prove that the circumcircles of triangles $AIH_1$, $BIH_B$, and $C_1IH_C$ have a common radical axis.
 On the other hand, the circumcenter $I$ of $ABC$ and the orthocenter $A_1H_A \cap B_1H_B \cap C_1H_C$ have the same power with respect to these three circumcircles. Therefore, these three circles have a common radical axis. Hence, the centers of these three circles, $O_A'$, $O_B'$, and $O_C'$, are collinear.
 Now, by Menelaus' theorem, we have
 \[\frac{C'O_A' \cdot B'O_C' \cdot A'O_B'}{O_A'B' \cdot O_C'A' \cdot O_B'C'} = 1\]
 \[\frac{C'O_A \cdot B'O_C \cdot A'O_B}{O_AB' \cdot O_CA' \cdot O_BC'} = 1\]
 Therefore, $O_A, O_B$, and $O_C$ are also collinear.

 <Step 8> Circles $\Gamma_A, \Gamma_B$, and $\Gamma_C$ have two common points

 Now, the circles $\Gamma_A, \Gamma_B$, and $\Gamma_C$ are inverted into circles. The centers of these three circles are collinear, as proven earlier. Therefore, these three circles either have a common radical axis or their radical axes are parallel. This property remains true before the inversion.
 However, in Step 1, we found point $T$ that has the same power with respect to these three circles. Therefore, circles $\Gamma_A, \Gamma_B$, and $\Gamma_C$ have a common radical axis.
 Furthermore, since point $T$ lies inside all three circles, this common radical axis intersects each circle at two distinct points. Therefore, the three circles have two common points.

## Candidate Response (to be graded)

**1. Summary**

**a. Verdict:**
I have successfully solved the problem. The proof relies on a known theorem concerning coaxial circles, and properties of mixtilinear incircles.

**b. Method Sketch:**
Let $\omega$ be the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$. Let $I$ be its incenter.
The points $D, E, F$ are the feet of the angle bisectors from $A, B, C$ to the opposite sides $BC, CA, AB$, respectively.
The points $T_A, T_B, T_C$ are the points of tangency of the $A$-, $B$-, $C$-mixtilinear incircles with $\omega$. By definition, $T_A, T_B, T_C$ lie on $\omega$.
Let $\Gamma_A, \Gamma_B, \Gamma_C$ be the circumcircles of $\triangle ADT_A, \triangle BET_B, \triangle CFT_C$ respectively. The problem asks to prove that $\Gamma_A, \Gamma_B, \Gamma_C$ share two common points $X, Y$. This is equivalent to proving that $\Gamma_A, \Gamma_B, \Gamma_C$ are coaxial.

The argument proceeds as follows:
1.  **Well-definedness of the circles:** We show that $A, D, T_A$ are not collinear, so $\Gamma_A$ is well-defined. The line $AD$ is the angle bisector $AI$. If $T_A$ were on $AI$, then $T_A$ must be $A$ or $M_A$ (the second intersection of $AI$ with $\omega$).
    *   $T_A \ne A$: If $T_A=A$, the $A$-mixtilinear incircle $\omega_A$ is tangent to $\omega$ at $A$. This implies that the center of $\omega_A$ (call it $K_A$) is on the line $OA$ (where $O$ is the circumcenter). Since $K_A$ is also on $AI$, this means $A,I,O$ are collinear, which implies $AB=AC$. However, $\triangle ABC$ is not isosceles, so $T_A \ne A$.
    *   $T_A \ne M_A$: It is a known property that $T_A=M_A$ if and only if $AB=AC$. Since $\triangle ABC$ is not isosceles, $T_A \ne M_A$.
    Thus, $A, D, T_A$ are not collinear. Similarly, $B, E, T_B$ and $C, F, T_C$ are not collinear, so $\Gamma_B, \Gamma_C$ are well-defined.

2.  **Properties of $D,E,F$:** The points $D,E,F$ are the feet of the angle bisectors. Since $I$ is an interior point of $\triangle ABC$, $D,E,F$ lie on the segments $BC,CA,AB$ respectively. For a non-degenerate triangle, such points $D,E,F$ are not collinear.

3.  **Properties of $T_A,T_B,T_C$:** It is a known property of the mixtilinear incircle tangency point $T_A$ that the line $AT_A$ is the $A$-symmedian of $\triangle ABC$. Similarly, $BT_B$ is the $B$-symmedian and $CT_C$ is the $C$-symmedian. Therefore, the lines $AT_A, BT_B, CT_C$ are concurrent at the symmedian point $K$ (also known as Lemoine point, $X_6$) of $\triangle ABC$.

4.  **Emelyanovs' Theorem:** We use the following theorem by E. Emelyanov and T. Emelyanova:
    Let $A_1, B_1, C_1$ be points on lines $BC, CA, AB$ respectively, and $A_2, B_2, C_2$ be points on the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$. The circumcircles of $\triangle AA_1A_2, \triangle BB_1B_2, \triangle CC_1C_2$ are coaxial if and only if ($A_1,B_1,C_1$ are collinear) or ($AA_2,BB_2,CC_2$ are concurrent).

5.  **Application of the Theorem:**
    In our problem, $D,E,F$ play the role of $A_1,B_1,C_1$, and $T_A,T_B,T_C$ play the role of $A_2,B_2,C_2$.
